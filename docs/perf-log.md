# Performance log

The benchmark harness reports bytes/s, tokens/s, and allocations per token.
Numbers are intentionally recorded only after running the harness on the
target Ruby and hardware; no unmeasured figures are presented as guarantees.

Run:

```sh
ruby -Ilib benchmark/run.rb
```

The JSON result includes `mb_per_s`, `tokens_per_s`, and cumulative Ruby
`allocations_per_token` for runtime, generated, and handwritten modes. JSON
also records each Flexr mode as a ratio against the handwritten baseline.
The large deterministic corpus can be materialized when needed:

```sh
ruby benchmark/corpora/generate_json.rb > benchmark/corpora/json_10mb.json
ruby -Ilib benchmark/run.rb --spec examples/json/lexer.flexr.rb \
  --input-file benchmark/corpora/json_10mb.json
```

On the local Ruby 4.0.0 environment, the default 140,000-byte JSON input and
three measured iterations produced the following sample. These are recorded
observations, not cross-machine guarantees.

| mode | MB/s | tokens/s | allocations/token | handwritten ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| runtime | 1.671 | 596,789 | 5.201 | 0.194x |
| generated | 1.604 | 572,954 | 4.201 | 0.187x |
| handwritten | 8.597 | 3,070,499 | 3.4 | 1.000x |

This sample is above the v1.0 measured regression floor of 0.18x, but below the
0.7x handwritten stretch target. The measured ratios are recorded explicitly
rather than presented as a claim that the stretch target has been reached.
Runtime is 1.042x generated in this sample, above the 0.2x runtime-mode risk
threshold. See ADR 0019 for the target revision.

### Byte/token cost estimate

The same 10 MB JSON corpus was measured with compact records and with 100
padding spaces after each numeric value. The compact sample had 3,448,271
tokens; the padded sample had 775,191 tokens. Solving
`elapsed = c_byte * bytes + c_token * tokens` from the two measurements gives
the following local estimates (one iteration, `backend :direct`):

| mode | c_byte | c_token |
|---|---:|---:|
| runtime | 619 ns/byte | 1.090 us/token |
| generated | 611 ns/byte | 0.983 us/token |

The padded corpus can be reproduced with
`FLEXR_JSON_PADDING_BYTES=100 ruby benchmark/corpora/generate_json.rb`.

## 2026-08-12

After adding bounded scanning and the compiler/generated-runtime
optimizations, the same Ruby 4.0.0 host produced this three-iteration sample:

| mode | MB/s | tokens/s | allocations/token | handwritten ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| runtime | 1.291 | 460,930 | 5.2 | 0.204x |
| generated | 1.129 | 403,388 | 5.21 | 0.178x |
| handwritten | 6.337 | 2,263,297 | 3.4 | 1.000x |

The portable regression comparison passes the recorded baseline ratios
(0.101x runtime and 0.107x generated). The generated ratio in this sample is
0.002 below the host-dependent 0.18x absolute floor, so the ordinary gate can
still vary across runs on this host. `auto` acceleration now stops trying a
region after repeated short runs, while explicit `strscan` and `regexp` modes
remain fixed choices for workloads that have measured long runs.
